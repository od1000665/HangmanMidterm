The hangman project implemented several forms of loops, arrays and logic. I used a while loop to keep the game going until the loop is broken while using if else statements to change aspects of the game and for loops to help check specific conditions such as guesses. I used  3 arrays to hold each list of words. I then used string manipulation to keep track of what letters the player has guessed and to match them up to the chosen word. Then I used conditional logic to check length and correct letters in the word and also used logic to keep the game loop running.
